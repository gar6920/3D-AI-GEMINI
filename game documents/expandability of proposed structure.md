Here's why that structure supports those goals:

Clear Separation of Concerns (Abstraction):

The top-level division into client/, server/, and desktop/ creates major boundaries. Your front-end display logic (PlayCanvas) is separate from your authoritative backend logic (Colyseus), which is separate from how the application is packaged for desktop. This is a fundamental layer of abstraction.

Within the server/, separating rooms/ (networking/state), game/ (core logic/validation), ai/ (AI/LLM interaction), and potentially db/ (database) encourages distinct layers. The Room doesn't need to know database details, it just interacts with the game logic layer.

Within the client/, separating scripts/ by feature (player/, building/, ui/, network/) helps isolate different parts of the front-end logic.

Modularity:

By grouping related files into folders based on feature or responsibility (e.g., all player-related scripts in client/scripts/player/, all server-side AI logic in server/src/ai/), the code becomes inherently modular. Each module ideally handles one specific aspect of the game.

Expandability:

When you want to add a new feature (like a detailed crafting system, new AI types, or more complex exploration mechanics), this structure makes it clearer where to add the new code. You'd likely create new files or even subfolders within the relevant client/scripts/systems/ or server/src/game/ directories.

Because existing modules have defined responsibilities, adding a new feature is less likely to require massive changes across unrelated parts of the codebase, assuming interfaces between modules are kept clean. You primarily add the new module and connect it where necessary.

In short: This structure provides a strong foundation that directly supports the architectural principles we discussed. While maintaining true modularity and clear abstractions always requires discipline during development (e.g., avoiding unnecessary dependencies between modules), this directory layout encourages good practices from the start and is well-suited for handling the complexity and future expansion of the game concept we've outlined.
