Here's a proposal for a focused MVP scope and the immediate next steps needed to start building it:

Proposed MVP Scope (Core Features Only):

Basic Player Control:

One Hero Class (e.g., Wizard).

Basic movement (keyboard/gamepad).

Basic Melee attack.

One core active ability (e.g., Wizard's Fire Bolt - simple version).

Ability to build the Command Post (instant build, fixed cost).

Ability to build one type of Troop (e.g., Grunt Bot) at the Command Post (instant build, fixed cost, limit of maybe 2-3 initially).

Basic Troop command: Attack-Move.

Core Views: TPS and maybe RTS view switching (FPS deferred).

Basic Combat Loop:

Core HP and Damage system.

One type of basic Invading AI (e.g., Scuttler) with simple behavior: Spawn outside, move towards Shrine, attack Shrine/Player/Troop if encountered. Basic HP.

A static Shrine object with HP as the defense objective.

Minimal Economy:

Players start with a fixed amount of Personal Money.

Earn a fixed amount of Personal Money per AI kill.

Spend Money only on Command Post and Troops for this MVP.

Core Networking (Colyseus):

Server setup.

Player connection / disconnection.

Synchronization of Player, Troop, and AI positions.

Basic HP updates / death events.

Basic Scene & Platform:

Simple PlayCanvas scene (ground plane, Shrine model, AI spawn points, maybe a simple wall section).

Placeholder visuals/geometry for units and structures.

Desktop build using a wrapper (e.g., Tauri or Electron).

Features Explicitly Excluded from Initial MVP:

LLM Integration (All aspects: strategy, voting, bot tasking, dialogue).

Land Tenure System / City Money / Donations / Voting.

Modular Building / Blueprints (only placing Command Post).

Multiple Hero Classes / Complex Abilities / Progression / Levels.

Multiple Troop Types / Troop Modes (beyond Attack-Move).

Multiple Invader Types / Sergeants / Head Entity / Complex AI behaviors / Fallbacks.

Communal Combat Units / Assistant Bots.

Artifact System / Market.

Exploration / Exterior NPCs / Intel System.

Iron Dome / Complex Defenses (beyond maybe a basic wall).

Detailed UI (only essential elements like HP, Money).

Split-screen Multiplayer (focus on single player connected online first).

Persistence (Database integration deferred).

Immediate Next Steps to Start the Prototype:

Finalize MVP Scope: Do you agree with the proposed minimal feature set above?

Define Core MVP Mechanics: We need specific numbers and simple mechanics for the MVP elements:

Wizard Hero: Base HP, speed, melee damage, Fire Bolt damage/cooldown/cost.

Grunt Bot: HP, speed, damage, range, Money cost.

Scuttler AI: HP, speed, damage, spawn rate/number.

Shrine: HP.

Starting Money & Money per kill.

Command Post cost.

Basic Networking Design: Outline the essential Colyseus room state properties and client-server messages needed for the MVP (player join, position updates, attack actions, damage events, death events).

Technology Setup: Initialize the basic project structures: PlayCanvas project, Colyseus server (Node.js), and chosen Desktop Wrapper project (e.g., Tauri).

This focused approach allows us to build and test the absolute core interaction – moving, building a basic unit, fighting a basic enemy, and basic networking – before adding the more complex layers like the LLM integration, detailed economy, and advanced building.
